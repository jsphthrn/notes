# Notes on Time Management
by José L. Yáñez 10-22

## Introduction

Most people usually think about the idea of productivity as *the more tasks one person executes, the most productive that person is, regardless of the quality*. 

Productivity is a primordial metric in work environments but, most of the times, their idea of productivity is just wrong. **Productivity is a matter of quality, rather than quantity**. 

### Concepts

Time management has to do a lot with the productivity of a person. So one of the first steps to increase productivy is to be able to **distinguish between less important tasks and most important tasks**. Once you've already determined what the less important and low-impact tasks are, the next step is to, willingly, **discard those tasks in order to increase performance in most important and high-impact tasks execution** and, thus, improve the quality of one's work yield.

Not all tasks have the same importance or value, not all tasks have the same priority. Some bunch of tasks must be executed first and before some other bunch of tasks. If there's no distinction on the importance of tasks priority, work yield could lack of expected quality.

### Urgency

Some employers and employees use urgency as a priority factor to determine the execution order of tasks. However, urgency tend to be a sample of lack of planification, [prevision] and drives to stressful situations.

### Less is more

Excess is present in our daily lifes: *To do more, to earn more, to work more, to spend is better*. In reality, **to do more is just to do more**. On actual times, we are immerse on a distraction world, there's always more to do, there's always something to improve and while this is not all wrong, treating important tasks as generic tasks decrements their value and their outcome. The contrary approach to this is **less is more**. 

Less is more **does not stand for just do less tasks** but to do only meaningful tasks. It implies that **one must simplify an activity, an assignment, a project to their very foundations**, to their very basics, **to use intellectual effort to simplify these activities**. Any other components are just annoyances. Then, one must **put effort on doing the reamining tasks better**.

Time optimization then can be said as the process to find the high-impact tasks, discard low-impact tasks and to execute better high-impact tasks.

## Actions

### Tasks

**Our time is a limited resource**. So we should search and find ways to manage better our unlimited to-do tasks in our finite time. **Tasks are the tiniest component in one's workflow**. Is a thing to do; I want to do, I must do, I could do. So the way we percieve a task is key in the way we find ways to execute it. In order to have a better perception of a task, one can consider the following advices:

#### Write your tasks as concise and specific actions.

Instead of *search for a plumber*, you could write *call top 3 plubmers announced in X platform*. When you have to do a specific task, ask yourself: "Whats the first thing I must do to complete this task?" The answer will be your first task.

Example:

You must do a report of the last three months. 

If you ask yourself *What's the first thing I must do to complete this task?*, you can come with an answer like:

- *Ask the Department for last three months data and format it*.

After you're done, ask the same question again. Now, your answer could be something like:

- *Decide two analysis methods to compare results and apply those methods to the last month's data*

One more time, ask the same question. The answer this time can be:

- *Write conclusions for this report in less than 200 characters*.

Then you're done.

#### Sort tasks according their execution nature.

It is good idea to make a distinction of your tasks so you can see the structure of the task and make it easier to simplify it. An example of this distinction is:

- Activities: tasks executed on a daily basis or on various occasions consistently during a period of time. i.e. meditate 30 minutes, read a book during 40 minutes.

- Products: tasks that are, usualy, executed once and that execution returns a specific result. i.e. deliver a schedule to the department, call the headquarters, write an article about time management.

#### Transform products into activities.

Often times people **feel more pressure when a task demands *yield* deliver**. Sometimes, this pressure make the perception of the task gets accompanied with feelings of anxiety and rejection, which can **lead to find *reasons* to not engage immediately on the task, postponing the execution**. This is known more colloquialy as **procrastination**.

One of the ways we can **break with procrastination** is to turn big and overwhelming product tasks into consistent activities. Instead of trying to get to the task goal in just one execution, use deferred execution. This is, **to execute the product task as a consistent activity through various executions so we keep doing little increments in progression instead of one-time execution**. 

This way, one's goal is to make that overwhelming product task more manageable, joyful and flexible. One can assign a specific amount of time per day to this task. At the end of the day, evaluate if the goal of the task is meet. If not, you can assign more time on that task for the next day and so on.
